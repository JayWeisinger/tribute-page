                Wes Montgomery was one of the most influential guitarists of the twentieth century. A performer, bandleader, lifelong musician and grammy award winning recording artist. He had an active career from the year 1947 until his untimely death in 1968. His work spanned across several genres of jazz including smooth jazz, hard bop, post bop, jazz-soul and jazz-fusion. His performances and recordings have been well received and highly praised by numerous publications including: Billboard, Metronome, DownBeat and Record World who awarded him Jazz Man of the Year. His distinctive style and techniques of playing set him apart from his contemporaries. Wes didn't play the guitar with a pick, instead using solely the side of his thumb to play fast paced sequences and block chords patterns. This technique made his sound incredibly smooth and easy on the ears while still maintaining a measured intensity.
